# Snake

The main character can be either a python (made up of n squares and initial score multiplier of x1)
or an anaconda (made up of 2n squares and initial score multiplier of x2) (chosen at start).
The snake is a new graduate looking for work. Random job offers appear on the game board as
items and the snake tries to catch them by eating them. The snake is constantly on the move, you
can only control her/his direction. The job offer items stay on the board for a limited amount of
time. For every job offer the snake catches, she/he earns points. However, the snake also needs
food. Thatâ€™s why she/he also needs to eat the food items from the board in order to maintain her/his
stamina that is constantly reduced over time. If stamina reaches zero, the game ends. Food items
also appear randomly on the board for a limited amount of time. The more job offers it eats, the
longer the snake becomes. Of course if the snake crashes on the borders or on itself the game ends.

After eating 5 job offers a round ends (the snake moves faster with every passing round). At the end
of every round, give the player an option to decorate her/his snake with one object from: foreign
languages (x2), training certificates (x3), internships (x1.5); each of which will add a small
multiplier to the base score-multiplier of the snake. The graphical interface must show the total
score-multiplier (decorations included).
